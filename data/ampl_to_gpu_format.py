"""
AMPL (.mod + .dat) -> shared GPU-format COO file, via a translation
layer through AMPL's own engine -- not a hand-written parser.

Why a translator instead of a parser
-------------------------------------
Unlike MPS/LP/CSV, a .mod file has no matrix in it at all -- it's an
algebraic modeling language (sets, indexed sums, expressions like
`sum{i in FEEDSTOCKS} cost[i]*x[i] <= budget`) that only becomes a
constraint matrix once something actually *interprets and expands* it.
Writing that interpreter from scratch is not something to attempt here
-- AMPL's own engine already does it correctly. So this module: loads
the .mod (+ optional .dat) into AMPL via its official Python API
(amplpy), asks AMPL itself to write out an MPS file (`write m<stub>;`
-- a real AMPL command, not custom logic), then hands that MPS file to
the EXISTING, already-tested canonicalize_mps() from mps_to_txt.py. No
new matrix-building logic lives in this file at all.

Requirements
------------
    pip install amplpy
    python -m amplpy.modules install ampl   # free "Community Edition"
                                             # engine, no license key
                                             # needed, capped around
                                             # 500 variables / 500
                                             # constraints

Both steps need to reach AMPL's own module server (pypi.ampl.com) --
if that's blocked (e.g. behind a restrictive proxy/firewall), this
fails with a clear ImportError-style message rather than a confusing
one.

IMPORTANT -- not tested end-to-end
------------------------------------
amplpy's Python package was confirmed to install cleanly, and its API
(AMPL.read, AMPL.read_data, AMPL.write) was verified directly against
its real docstrings via `help()` -- this is not guessed syntax. But the
actual AMPL solving engine could not be downloaded in the sandboxed
environment this was written in (its module server, pypi.ampl.com, was
blocked by the local network proxy: 403 Forbidden). Test this for real
on a machine with normal internet access -- and with a real .mod/.dat
pair -- before relying on it for a live demo.

GAMS is deliberately NOT supported here: unlike AMPL, GAMS has no free,
pip-installable engine at all (its Python API requires a full licensed
GAMS installation), so a from-scratch GAMS translator can't be built or
tested the same way. If GAMS support becomes a real requirement, it
needs a licensed GAMS install as a prerequisite -- flag that
explicitly rather than silently pretending it's supported.

Usage
-----
    python ampl_to_gpu_format.py model.mod --out problem.txt
    python ampl_to_gpu_format.py model.mod --data model.dat --out problem.txt
